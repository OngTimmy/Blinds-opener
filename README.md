# Automatic Blinds Opener
## Description
A tiny machine meant to help people wake up more easily in the mornings by letting in sunlight at a user set time. The machine is mounted to the wall right beside the blinds using [Command adhesive wall hooks.](https://www.command.com/3M/en_US/command/products/~/Command-Large-Utility-Hook/?N=5924736+3294529207+3294773688&rt=rud)
## CAD Process
### The Hook
I did my best to model the actual hook in Solidworks in order to have a reference to work with and figure out how to mount a motor onto the hook. I uploaded images of the hook to solidworks and traced out the general shape, then used the boundary boss/base feature to finish the model.
